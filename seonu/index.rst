Overview
========

FÃ¦reld is a tool to track time spent on projects/tasks, split into specific
areas. The tool also outputs summary visualisations of the data, and will
eventually implement POSTing this data as JSON to an endpoint.

The production of this tool was motivated by a desire to track, visualise and
optimise the amount of focused time I spend on various projects/areas.
